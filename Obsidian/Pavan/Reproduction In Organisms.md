#reproduction
# Life Span
The period from birth to natural death is called Life Span
Life Span differs from one organism to another.

# Reproduction
Reproduction is a biological processby which new 'offspring' individuals are produced by their parents.It involves transmission of genetic material from one generation to another.

# Types Of Reproduction
-Asexual Reproduction
-Sexual Reproduction

## Asexual Reproduction
The reproduction by a single parent without fusion of gametes.
It results in genetically identical offspring.

## Sexual Reproduction
The reproduction involves fusion of two gametes to form a zygote which develops into a new individual.It leads to genetic variation.

# Clone
Identical offspring from a single parent is called Clone

# Types Of Asexual Reproduction

## Fission
The type of asexual reproduction which involves ony cell division occurs only in unicellular organisms Ex-Monerans and Protists.

### Binary Fission
The division of a cell into two identcal daughter cells.

### Multiple Fission
The repeated division parent nucleus followed by cytoplasmic divisions forms many daughter cells within one parent cell.

## Zoospores
The flagellated motile bodies produced by mitotic divisions which are releases to water. Ex-Algae bodies(Chlamydomanas and Ulothrix)

## Sporangiospores
The non-flagellated asexual spores produced in sporangia.Ex-Fungi like(Rhizopus) released into air during thier asexual repoduction

## Conidiospores(Conidia)
These are also non-flagellated asexual spores commonly occured in fungi like Penicilium and Aspergillus.Coutntless such spores are produced in chains and easily dispersed into wind and germinate into new individuals.

## Budding
The type of asexual reproduction where the new individual is produced as an outgrowth (bud) of the parent and later released as independent identical copy of the parent.Ex-Hydra,Yeasts

## Gemmules
The internal buds which have a specalized mass of cells that can develop into an offspring.Ex-Sponges

## Fragmentation
The type of reproduction in whhich parent breaks down into fragments which can develop into a new individual.Ex-Algae like Spirogyra

## Vegetative Propagation
This is also a type of asexual reproduction in which buds grow and develop subsequently get detached and grow into new plants.

### Types of Vegetative Propagation
#### Vegetative Propagation by Roots
In some plants root tubers get formed and produce adventitous buds containing part of root and get separated into new plants.Ex-Sweet Potato

#### Vegetative Propagation by Leaves
In some plants adventitious buds are produced from leaves.The buds are produced at the notches along the leaf margin.Ex-Bryophyllum

#### Vegetative Propagation by Stem
In plants stems are specialized into underground(rhizome,stem tuber,bulb and corm),subaerial stems(runner,stolon,sucker and offset) and aerial stems(bulbils)
help in process of vegetative propagation.The underground stem modification helps in performing reproduction,store food.

##### Underground stem modification
###### Rhizome
It is a horizontally growing underground stem
